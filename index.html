              stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. HTML is the standard markup
              language for creating Web pages. HTML describes the structure of a
              Web page. HTML consists of a series of elements. HTML elements
              tell the browser how to display the content. HTML elements label
              pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a

              Learn web development | MDN 29 Feb 2024 â€” HTML (HyperText Markup
              Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its
              content. For example, content could be structured within a set of
              paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data
              tables. As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic
              understanding of HTML and its functions. HTML is the most basic
              building block of the web, and is often assisted by other
              technologies like Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting
              languages like JavaScript. HTML is beginner-friendly, open-source,
              and free, and is widely used with a large community behind it.
              However, HTML is primarily used for static websites, and users
              have to create individual web pages for HTML, even if the elements
              are the same. Some browsers also adopt new features slowly.</span

            CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, which is a computer language
            that describes how to structure and lay out web pages written in
            HTML or XML. CSS is made up of coding elements and "cascading style
            sheets," also known as CSS files. CSS is a cornerstone technology of
            the World Wide Web, along with HTML and JavaScript.

          <p>
            JavaScript (JS) is a text-based programming language used both on
            the client-side and server-side that allows you to make web pages
            interactive. It is one of the three core technologies of World Wide
            Web content production (along with HTML and CSS). JavaScript is a
            high-level, interpreted programming language. This means that it is
            relatively easy to learn and use, and that it does not need to be
            compiled before it can be run. JavaScript is also a dynamic
            programming language, which means that the behavior of a JavaScript
            program can change at runtime.

          <h1>REACT</h1>
          <p>
            React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for
            building user interfaces based on components. It is maintained by
            Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community of individual developers
            and companies. React can be used to develop single-page, mobile, or
            server-rendered applications with frameworks like Next.js. React
            makes it easy to create interactive UIs by using a declarative
            approach. You can create simple views for each state in your
            application, and React will efficiently update and render the right
            components when the data changes.

          <p>
            Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers
            to create scalable network applications. It is built on Chrome's V8
            JavaScript engine, which makes it very fast and efficient. Node.js
            is open source and cross-platform, so it can be used on any
            operating system. One of the key features of Node.js is its
            event-driven architecture. This means that Node.js can handle
            multiple requests at the same time without blocking. This makes it
            ideal for real-time applications such as chat rooms and streaming
            services.
